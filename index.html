  <h2>How to use the app</h2>
  <p> The app is mainly designed for bikers, swimmers, runners, and potentially other sports that involve racing.
      Bikers can utilize the first feature which provides their speed. However, this can only be done if the user location is turned on
      When entering your targeted pace, users will hear either a low pitch or a high pitch. A low pitch would imply the user is behind pace and     
      a high pitch would imply the user is ahead of pace. Note: the last pitch you hear provides insight if you are on pace </p>
  
  <p> Regarding other sports such as runninng or swimming(must have waterproof earbuds), atheletes would utilze the second feature- audio timer.  
      To make use of this, you would need two users since one person needs to start the timer - given you don't want to carry your phone. This feature
      notifies athletes how much time has passed every 5 seconds. </p>
  
  <h2>Future features</h2>
  <p> In the future, given the amount of users or feedback, I plan to make it availble on smart-watches. This would make feasible for users to not have 
      the need to carry their phones with them when exercising. </p>
